I am a researcher on the [interpretability team](https://transformer-circuits.pub/) at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) where I try to reverse engineer how language models compose microscopic building blocks into higher level computational circuits.

<!-- I am a third year PhD student researching language model interpretability at the MIT ORC advised by [Dimitris Bertsimas](https://www.dbertsim.mit.edu/). I am interested in developing a mechanistic understanding of neural networks and using this to better monitor, control, and align advanced AI systems. I am fortunate to also collaborate with [Neel Nanda](https://www.neelnanda.io/about) and [Max Tegmark](https://tegmark.org/) and am graciously supported by an Open Philanthropy early career grant. -->

I completed my PhD at MIT where I worked with [Dimitris Bertsimas](https://www.dbertsim.mit.edu/), [Max Tegmark](https://tegmark.org/), and [Neel Nanda](https://www.neelnanda.io/about) on interpretability. Before that, I was a software engineer at Google working on data pipelines for the storage analytics team, and researched fairness-optimized political redistricting with [David Shmoys](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/shmoys/).
